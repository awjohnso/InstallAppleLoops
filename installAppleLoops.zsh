# What this script does:
# This script will download zipped DMG files from a web server. It will then
# unzip the files, mount the DMG and install all the Apple audio loop PKG files 
# located within the DMG. It will then unmount the DMG, remove the zipped file, 
# and the DMG file.
#
# Requirements:
# In oder for this to work use appleloops (https://github.com/carlashley/appleloops)
# by Carl Carlashley to create the DMG files for the mandatory and optional loops.
# Compress the DMG files into a zip file and store them on a server. Also the DMG 
# volume must be called appleloops.
#
# Reasoning:
# 1. JamfPro Cloud does not seem to have the ability to import files larger 
#    than twenty something gigs. The optional loops are close to fourty gigs.
# 2. In order to run appleloops on the clients, they really need Python 3, and
#    we prefer not to install it.
# 3. As of the creation date of this script, appleloops misses thirty or more 
#    audio units for GarageBand 10.4.5, which I was able to snag and throw into
#    the mandatory DMG.
